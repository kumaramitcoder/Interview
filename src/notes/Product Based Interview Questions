Q)Explain ConcurrentModificationException in Java

✅️Ans)

The ConcurrentModificationException occurs when a collection is modified while being iterated using an iterator or enhanced for-loop.

❓️When Does It Happen?

❌️It happens when:

You modify a collection (like ArrayList, HashMap) while iterating over it using an iterator.

🧶You modify a collection (like ArrayList, HashMap) while iterating over it using an iterator.

🧶The iterator detects the structural modification and throws ConcurrentModificationException.

🗳Example:
👇
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
 list.add("A");
 list.add("B");
 list.add("C");
 // Iterating using for-each loop
 for (String s : list) {
 if (s.equals("B")) {
 list.remove(s); // Throws ConcurrentModificationException
 }
 }

❌️Why Does This Fail?

🔹️The for-each loop uses an Iterator internally.

🔹️The remove(s) modifies the list while iterating.

🔹️The Iterator detects this modification and throws ConcurrentModificationException.

❌️How to Avoid ConcurrentModificationException?

✅ Method 1: Use Iterator.remove()
✅️ Method 2: UseCopyOnWriteArrayList (Thread-Safe)
✅ Method 3 :Iterate backward to avoid shifting issues.
✅Method 4:Use ConcurrentHashMap for safe concurrent operations.
