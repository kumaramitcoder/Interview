How Does HashMap InternallyWork in Java? (Crack Any Interview with This Guide!) 👨‍💻🚀

If you’re preparing for a Java interview, understanding HashMap’s internal workings is crucial and is one of most asked interview question. Let’s break it down step by step.

🟣What is a HashMap?

A HashMap in Java is part of the java.util package and is used to store key-value pairs. It provides O(1) average time complexity for insert, delete, and get operations, making it one of the most efficient data structures.

🌴Key properties of a HashMap:

🔹️Stores elements in a key-value pair format.

🔹️Allows one null key and multiple null values.

🔹️The null key is always stored at the 0th index in the bucket array.

🔹️It is not synchronized, meaning it is not thread-safe.

🔹️Maintains no order of elements.

🟣Internal Working of HashMap

HashMap uses hashing to store key-value pairs efficiently. Let’s go step by step to understand its internal functioning.

🌴1. Hashing and Bucket Storage

🔹️HashMap internally maintains an array of Node<K, V> (buckets) where each node is a linked list entry.

🔹️When we insert a key-value pair, the key’s hashCode() is calculated.

🔹️This hash value is then converted into an index using the formula:

index = (hashCode) & (n - 1);

where n is the size of the bucket array (initially 16).

🟣2. Handling Collisions

🔹️When multiple keys generate the same index (collision), they are stored in the same bucket as a linked list.

🔹️In Java 8, when the linked list size exceeds 8, it gets converted into a balanced binary tree (Red-Black Tree) to optimize lookup time.

🟣3. Retrieving Values from HashMap

🔹️When calling get(key), HashMap calculates the hashCode and determines the index.

🔹️It then traverses the linked list/tree to find the correct key and return the associated value.
