❓️1️⃣Now How Set work internally :

✅️A HashSet is backed by a HashMap, so understanding how a HashMap works is key to understanding HashSet.

🌴HashSet Internals :

💎When you call add(element) on a HashSet, it internally calls the put method of the backing HashMap.

💎The element is stored as the key in the HashMap.

💎A dummy value (constant PRESENT) is stored as the value.

2️⃣.The HashMap uses hashing to determine where the key (element) should be stored.

3️⃣.If two elements have the same hash code (hash collision), the equals() method is used to differentiate between them

🟣🟣Step-by-Step Process: Avoiding Duplicates :

📌1.Compute Hash Code:

💎The hashCode() method of the object is called.

💎A hash code is an integer generated based on the object’s internal state.

📌2.Determine Bucket:

The hash code is converted into a bucket index using the formula

index = hashCode % arraySize;

The bucket is essentially an index in an internal array

📌3.Check for Duplicates:

💎If the bucket is empty, the element is stored.

💎If the bucket already contains elements (collision occurs), the equals() method is used to check if the new element is equal to any existing element in the bucket:

💎If equals() returns true: The element is considered a duplicate and is not added.

💎If equals() returns false: The element is added to the bucket (linked list or tree structure in case of collisions)

🔹️Internal Diagram:
👉Initial State:
👇
HashSet -> HashMap -> Array of Buckets
 [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] ...


🔹️After Adding “Apple” and “Banana”
👇
HashSet -> HashMap -> Array of Buckets
 [ ] [ ] ["Apple"] [ ] [ ] ["Banana"] [ ] [ ] ...


🔹️After Collision (e.g., Adding Two Elements with Same Hash Code)
👇
HashSet -> HashMap -> Array of Buckets
 [ ] [ ] [LinkedList: "Apple" -> "Orange"] [ ] [ ] ["Banana"] [ ] [ ] ...
