HLD and LLD are one of the core part for all levels of interviews . knowledge on this will make or break. it's a vast topic and today we are going through the basics ,what's different between them, at what point of the which one is being used.

💡 Memorization Tip:
 Think of HLD as a city map 🗺️ and LLD as a building plan 🏢!

Key Points: HLD vs. LLD:
✅ High-Level Design (HLD)

🔹️Provides an architectural blueprint of the system.

🔹️Focuses on major components, module interactions, and scalability.

🔹️Includes technology stack, APIs, databases, and security concerns.

🔹️Used by architects and senior developers during early design stages.

🔹️Example: “User authentication will be handled via JWT and OAuth.”

✅ Low-Level Design (LLD):

🔹️Defines the detailed implementation of each module.

🔹️Covers class diagrams, data structures, business logic, and APIs.

🔹️Specifies database schemas, function specifications, and error handling.

🔹️Used by developers and engineers for coding and implementation.

🔹️Example: “LoginService will validate users using Spring Security and JWT tokens.”

✅ HLD vs. LLD: Key Differences :

🔹️HLD: Big-picture architecture 🏗️ | LLD: Code-level details 💻

🔹️HLD: System-wide security & scalability 🔐 | LLD: Module-specific security & optimization ⚙️

🔹️HLD: High-level components like APIs & services 🔄 | LLD: Classes, methods, & logic 🛠️

✅ Use Case: E-commerce Order Processing System :

🔹️HLD: Defines major services (User, Order, Payment, Inventory).

🔹️LLD: Details class structures, API requests, database schema.

📌What is HLD❓️

High-Level Design (HLD) provides an architectural blueprint of a system. It outlines the overall structure, major components, and their interactions while focusing on scalability, security, and system-wide decisions.

📌What is LLD❓️

Low-Level Design (LLD) delves into the internal workings of the system. It provides a detailed breakdown of each module, including class diagrams, data structures, algorithms, and logic implementation.
