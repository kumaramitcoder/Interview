Scenario 1: Zero-Downtime Deployments for Microservices

❓️1Q)Your team wants to deploy a new version of the Order Service without downtime. How do you achieve this?

✅️Solution:

🔹️Use Blue-Green Deployment or Canary Releases.

🔹️Implement Feature Flags to enable gradual rollout.

🌴Example:
👇
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
 name: order-service-green
spec:
 replicas: 3
 selector:
 matchLabels:
 app: order-service


🔹 Key Concepts: Kubernetes, Canary Deployments, Feature Flags.


❓️2Q)Your API Gateway is overloaded due to high traffic. Some users make too many requests, affecting others. How do you prevent abuse?

✅️Solution:

🔹️Implement Rate Limiting (Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket).

🔹️Use API Gateway Security Features (JWT, OAuth).

🌴Example :
👇
@Bean
public KeyResolver userKeyResolver() {
 return exchange -> Mono.just(exchange.getRequest().getHeaders().getFirst("X-User-Id"));
}

🔹 Key Concepts: Rate Limiting, API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway, Nginx), Security.

🟣Scenario 3: Handling 502 Bad Gateway Errors in Production

❓️Q3)Your microservices are running on AWS ECS. Randomly, some API calls fail with 502 Bad Gateway. There are no clear error logs. How do you debug this?

✅️Solution:

🔹️Monitor API latency and service health metrics (New Relic, Prometheus).

🔹️Check load balancer logs for connection timeouts or container crashes.

🔹️Implement retry mechanisms on transient failures.

http:
 retries:
 attempts: 3
 perTryTimeout: 2s

🔹 Key Concepts: AWS ECS, Load Balancer Debugging, Logging, New Relic.


❓️Q4)Your system receives millions of read requests per second. Database reads are slowing down. How do you optimize it?

✅️Solution:

🔹️Implement CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).

🔹️Use a Read Replica Database or ElasticSearch for queries.

🌴Example:
👇
@Query("SELECT * FROM product_read WHERE category = ?1")
List<Product> findByCategory(String category);

🔹 Key Concepts: CQRS, Read Replicas, ElasticSearch, NoSQL.

❓️Q5)Your Order Service emits an order_created event. The Payment Service and Inventory Service consume this event asynchronously. How do you ensure they process the event exactly once?

✅️Solution:

🔹️Implement Event Sourcing (Kafka, Debezium).

🔹️Use Idempotency Keys to prevent duplicate processing.

🔹️Maintain Event Logs for Retry.

🌴Example:
👇
@KafkaListener(topics = "order_created")
public void processEvent(String message) {
 if (!isDuplicate(message)) {
 saveEvent(message);
 }
}

🔹 Key Concepts: Event Sourcing, Kafka, Exactly-Once Semantics.
