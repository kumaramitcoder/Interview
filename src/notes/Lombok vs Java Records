Lombok vs Java Records: Java DTO

Java developers have long battled with boilerplate code. Getters, setters, constructors, equals, hashCode, toString… we’ve written them all, again and again. To fight this verbosity, tools like Project Lombok came to the rescue. But now, with the introduction of Java Records, the landscape is shifting.

Let’s explore both, compare them in depth, and find out which one deserves a spot in your toolbox moving forward.

🧰 What Is Lombok?

Lombok is a popular Java library that uses annotations to reduce boilerplate code. With a few simple annotations, Lombok can automatically generate:
🔹️Getters and setters
🔹️Constructors
🔹️equals(), hashCode(), toString()
🔹️Builders
🔹️Logging fields
🔹️Synchronized blocks
🔹️And much more

🌳Example:
👇
@Data
public class User {
 private String name;
 private int age;
}

The @Data annotation in Lombok automatically generates getters, setters, toString(), equals(), hashCode(), and constructors.

📦 What Are Java Records?

Introduced in Java 14 (preview) and made stable in Java 16, records are a new type of class in Java that are:

✅ Immutable by default
✅ Meant for data carriers
✅ Automatically generate:
🔹️Constructor
🔹️Getters
🔹️equals() & hashCode()
🔹️toString()

🌳Example: Record in Action :
👇
public record User(String name, int age) {}

That’s it. One line replaces 30+ lines of boilerplate.

🌳❓️When to Use Lombok :

🔹️You need mutable classes
🔹️You require the Builder pattern
🔹️You’re working with older Java versions (<16)
🔹️You want to auto-generate methods selectively
🔹️You need more flexibility and annotations like @Synchronized, @Slf4j, etc.

❌ Limitations of Lombok:
🔹️IDE compatibility issues (though rare now)
🔹️Build complications in CI/CD
🔹️Hidden bugs (e.g., with equals/hashCode) if used improperly
🔹️Need to install and manage an external dependency

🌳🔍❓️ When to Use Java Records:

🔹️You’re modeling pure data classes
🔹️Immutability is desired (which is often a best practice)
🔹️You’re using Java 16+
🔹️You want cleaner code with zero dependencies
🔹️You’re building DTOs, configuration models, or value objects

❌ Limitations of Java Records:
🔹️Records are final and immutable — you can’t change fields after creation
🔹️No setter methods
🔹️Can’t extend other classes
🔹️No support for Builder pattern
🔹️All fields must be declared in the record header

🌳Practical Use Cases

📌Java Records are perfect here:
👇
public record ProductDTO(String id, String name, double price) {}

This eliminates 90% of boilerplate for simple data carriers.

🏗️ Complex Domain Models :
If you need:
🔹️Custom constructor logic
🔹️Builder pattern
🔹️Mutable state
🔹️Logging inside the class

👉 Then Lombok is your best friend.

This gives you fine-grained control over each field, method, and constructor.
