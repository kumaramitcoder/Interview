In modern Spring Boot development, calling REST APIs is a common task. Choosing the right client‚ÄîRestTemplate, WebClient, or FeignClient‚Äîimpacts performance, maintainability, and scalability. Here‚Äôs a concise breakdown of all three.

üîπ RestTemplate (Traditional HTTP Client)
Synchronous and blocking HTTP client.
Introduced in Spring 3.
Simple to use for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Lacks flexibility for reactive or non-blocking programming.

Example:
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(url, String.class);
üîª Deprecated for future development. Recommended to use WebClient.

üîπ WebClient (Modern Reactive Client)
Introduced in Spring WebFlux (Spring 5).
Supports both blocking and non-blocking calls.
Ideal for reactive programming and asynchronous workflows.
Enables better performance and scalability in concurrent systems.

Example:
WebClient webClient = WebClient.create();
webClient.get()
 .uri(url)
 .retrieve()
 .bodyToMono(String.class)
 .subscribe(System.out::println);
‚úÖ Best for new Spring Boot applications, especially with high concurrency.

üîπ FeignClient (Declarative HTTP Client)
Part of Spring Cloud OpenFeign.
Makes REST calls using declarative interfaces.
Simplifies communication between microservices.
Automatically handles load balancing, fallback, and request mapping.

Example:
@FeignClient(name = "user-service")
public interface UserClient {
 @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
 User getUser(@PathVariable Long id);
}
‚úÖ Great choice for Spring Cloud projects and service-to-service calls.

‚öñÔ∏è Summary:
RestTemplate: Simple, synchronous, now outdated.

WebClient: Modern, flexible, reactive, and scalable.

FeignClient: Declarative, clean, built for microservices.

Choose WebClient for reactive apps, FeignClient for microservices, and avoid new development with RestTemplate.

üí° Pro Tip: Use WebClient when performance and scalability matter. Use FeignClient to simplify service integration in Spring Cloud.
