Q)write a Java stream program to Find the longest string in a list?

🌴Ans) let's break it down.

we can resolve this in many ways.

✅️one we can use reduce()

and

✅️other way is to use collect ()

I have shared both the ways and hope this will help you to get an understanding of different ways in Java stream API .

step 1) convert the list to stream

Step 2) call reduce() and check as below
or use collect ()



1️⃣🌴Example:
👇

 list<String> words = Arrays.asList("Java", "Stream", "API", "Development");

String longest = words
 .stream()
 .reduce((word1, word2) -> word1.length() > word2.length() ? word1 : word2)
 .orElse(null);

System.out.println(longest);

 👉Output: Development


 🟣 🟣 🟣 OR 🟣🟣🟣


2️⃣Example:

String longestStr = words
 .stream()
 .collect(Collectors
.maxBy(Comparator.comparingInt(String::length)))
 .get();


 System.out.println("\nLongest String is = " + longestStr);
