write a Java stream program to Find numbers that appear exactly once in the list?

✅️Ans) let's break it down.

💎step 1) convert the list to stream.

💎step 2) call filter() with collections.frequency()==1 to get number came once.

💎step 3) print the result.

Example:
👇

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5);
 List<Integer> singleOccurrence = numbers
 .stream()
 .filter(num -> Collections
 .frequency(numbers, num) == 1)
 .collect(Collectors.toList());


 System.out.println("Numbers Occurring Once: " + singleOccurrence);
