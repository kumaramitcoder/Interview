Q)write a Java stream program to Get the names of departments and average salaries of employees in each department, but only include departments where the average salary is greater than $70,000❓️

🗳Ans) let's break it down.

🌳step 1) convert the list to stream.

🌳Step 2) call Collectors.groupingBy () with departments and average salary .

🌳Step 3) call filter () value >70000

🌳step 4) call Collect() to get the result

✅️Example:
👇

 List<Employee> employees = List.of(
new Employee("Alice", "Engineering", 85000),new Employee("Bob", "Engineering", 72000),new Employee("Charlie", "HR", 65000),new Employee("David", "HR", 60000),new Employee("Eve", "Marketing", 95000)
 );


 Map<String, Double> highAvgSalaries = employees
 .stream()
 .collect(groupingBy
 (Employee::getDepartment, averagingDouble(
 Employee::getSalary)))
 .entrySet().stream()
 .filter(entry -> entry
 .getValue() > 70000)
 .collect(toMap(Map.Entry::getKey, Map.Entry::getValue));


 highAvgSalaries.forEach((dept, avgSalary) ->
 System.out.println(dept + " avg salary: " + avgSalary));
