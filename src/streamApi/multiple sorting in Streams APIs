multiple sorting in Streams APIs. Name & salary

🟣Q)write a Java stream program to sort a list of employees first by name and then by salary, you can combine comparators using the thenComparing method ?

🌳Ans) let's break it down.

generally we use Comparator.comparing() but here we need to sort twice, so we can call thenComparingDouble() .this method can be called multiple times as per the need.

✅️step 1) convert the list to stream.

✅️step 2) call sorted () with Comparator.comparing() with employees name

✅️ step 3)then call thenComparingDouble () with employee salary.

✅️step 4) call Collectors.toList to get the result.

✅️step 5) print the result.

🌳Example:
 👇

// Sort by name and then by salary in ascending order

 List<Employee> sortedByNameAndSalaryAsc = employees
 .stream()
 .sorted(Comparator
 .comparing(Employee::getName)
 .thenComparingDouble(Employee::getSalary))
 .collect(Collectors.toList());



 System.out.println("Sorted by Name and Salary (Ascending):");
 sortedByNameAndSalaryAsc.forEach(System.out::println);
